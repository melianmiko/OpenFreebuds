Build or start from sources
-------------

Requirements:

- Windows 10/11, or enough modern Linux;
- Qt 6.0+ development tools, at least Linguist's `lrelease`;
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.11+), [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) (1.8+);
- (Windows, optional) [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download), [UPX](https://upx.github.io/);
- (Linux, optional) Build essentials and some libraries.

Also, some dev-scripts may have their own requirements, like `python3-polib` for
`./scripts/sync_translations.sh`. Setup poetry env and dependencies before 
continue:

```shell
poetry install
```

### Just launch without installation

```shell
./scripts/make.py build_launch
```

### Windows

If everything above is installed & added to `PATH`, just run:

```shell
.\scripts\build_win32\make.cmd
```

Output binaries will be located in `scripts\build_win32\dist`

### Debian/Ubuntu

Install all packaging dependencies automated way:
`apt install build-essentials && ./scripts/install_dpkg_dependencies.sh`.

```shell
dpkg-buildpackage -b
```

Output file will be located in parent folder (`../*.deb`).
